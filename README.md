# sochiDG

sochiDG is a Python-based iPhone 5S (Global) downgrader. However, this will only support iOS 7.1.2.

# Compatibility

macOS Tahoe and earlier (Intel) only supported (for now). This can run in both Python 3.9 and 3.14, but I have not tested other versions.

# How to run and execute (and downgrade)
* Step 1: CD into the downgrade by typing in "cd sochiDG" or "cd 5s_downgrade"
* Step 2: Run this command: "python3 main.py". However, you need to install the necessary tools put in the tools folder as this tool is in very rough condition.
* Step 3: Downgrade
* Step 4: Boot
* Step 5: Hacktivate
* Step 6: Profit

# Pretty necessary stuff

* The full downgrade folder will be 2.92 GB as downloading everything in the program might cause faliure in the process.
* Since this downgrade tool is unstable and buggy, I would reccomend other developers to enhance my code. I also do not mind at all, if anyone puts my downgrade logic and code into their program.
